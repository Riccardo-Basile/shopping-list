# Shopping List

Vanilla JavaScript shopping list app from Brad Traversy Modern JS From The Beginning course.

This project was created to focus on working with the DOM, events, state, local storage and other fundamentals of JavaScript.

In the future I could come back and implement it with db, add some more features and re-style the UI.
